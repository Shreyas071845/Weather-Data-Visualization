## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

This dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:  

- 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – Main data visualization platform used for report creation  
- 📁 **Power Query** – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the API data  
- 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic  
- 🗂️ **Data Modeling** – Relationships established between tables (weather data, forecast, air quality index) to enable cross-visual analysis  
- 📑 **File Format** – `.pbix` for development and `.png` for dashboard preview
